        <h1>Ecotopia</h1>
        <p>We were inspired by the problem that humans, globally, generate about 1.3 billion tons of trash per year, which is far more than we can properly process or recycle. For that reason, we decided that we should contribute to reducing the amount of waste humans produce by targeting one of the three R's: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. With the rise of sustainability of our times, we aim to teach our future generations to recycle the waste and how should protect endangered species</p>
