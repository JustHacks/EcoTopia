# EcoTopia

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the problem that humans, globally, generate about 1.3 billion tons of trash per year, which is far more than we can properly process or recycle. For that reason, we decided that we should contribute to reducing the amount of waste humans produce by targeting one of the three R's: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. With the rise of sustainability of our times, we aim to teach our future generations to recycle the waste and how should protect endangered species

## What it does
The website has the user to buy the eco-friendly products. And user can exchange their plastic products to buy eco-friendly products. The plastic product will be sent out to the recycling factories. Eco-friendly products promote green living that help to conserve energy and also prevent air, water and noise pollution. They prove to be boon for the environment and also prevent human health from deterioration

Recycling reduces the need for extracting, refining and processing raw materials all of which create air and water pollution.

We have AR feature where you will be able to find and learn about endangered animals. And you can able experience the AR.

## How we built it

We build it with Html, css and javascript, as well as tensorflow.js for the machine learning camera. We also designed the webapp and logo on figma. Then we used Echo-AR to build an augmented reality endagered animal feature! We also used canva for slides.
